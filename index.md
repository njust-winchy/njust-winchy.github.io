## Welcome to My Pages

My name is Wu Wenqing , 27 years old. I am currently studying for a Ph.D. at Nanjing University of Science and Technology, with a focus on Management Science and Engineering.

I am very interested in technology, if you are interested in python programming, or are learning deep learning, we can communicate more. I’m trying to build a solid foundation in these areas and hope to do well during my Ph.D.
